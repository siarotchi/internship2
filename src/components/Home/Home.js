          <h1>Domain Experience</h1>
          <h2>Accounting, Business</h2>
          <p>
            For 8 years i lead records and statistics of sales where acquired
            analytical thinking, the ability to work calmly with a large amount
            of information and tasks. The ability to sort and distribute tasks
            has become the basis for successful work. And, of course, i'm get
            into the habit of meeting the deadlines because of the specifics of
            work all reports must be submitted on time monthly.
          </p>

          <h2>Managing, Retail network</h2>
          <p>
            Working on a network, i began to communicate with people much more,
            acquiring new communication skills. Then i consolidate my ability to
            solve problems, because there were many more of them on the network.
            The ability to find solutions by any means without fear of new
            actions. When i became a Senior operator, i'm acquired a new
            mentoring skill. I've trained the operator from scratch until his
            replacement, which gave me experience and understanding of the
            complexity of the training process. And teamwork, where i learned to
            divide work by complexity and help to resolve problems to covering
            each other’s backs.
          </p>
          <h2>IT Developer, Self Education</h2>
          <p>
            Starting a new career growth in a new industry, i broke my usual way
            of life for a new goal. I got out of my comfort zone, which brought
            me a lot of stress, but added more fuel to my engine to continue
            learning new skills and abilities. This is a new limitless world
            that allows you to constantly develop your skills and become a
            better person than you were yesterday.
